An AI-powered financial advisor system built with Spring Boot and React, implementing a Plan-Execute-Evaluate agentic architecture using LangChain4j. The system features seven specialized AI agents — PlannerAgent, EvaluatorAgent, UserProfile, MarketAnalysis, WebSearch, FintwitAnalysis, and Security — coordinated through an orchestrator that runs a self-correcting agentic loop. A PlannerAgent (LLM) analyzes each user query and creates a structured execution plan, sub-agents execute plan steps in parallel, and an EvaluatorAgent reviews results and synthesizes responses or requests retries with feedback. All query understanding is done by LLMs with no hardcoded regex patterns or manual bypasses. Key technical achievements include real-time WebSocket streaming of agent reasoning steps and tool execution for transparent decision-making, direct tool call tracking with human-friendly formatting in a dedicated thinking panel, real-time market data integration via Finnhub API with mandatory tool usage enforcement to prevent outdated training data, Google OAuth integration for secure authentication, portfolio management with automatic gain/loss calculations and price refresh, web search via Tavily API and social sentiment analysis from financial Twitter for market insights, professional financial analyst-level analysis including technical patterns, stop-loss levels, and entry/exit strategies, per-session rate limiting using Bucket4j token bucket algorithm to prevent API abuse, and comprehensive security measures with JWT authentication and input validation. Built with Java 21, Spring Boot, LangChain4j, React, PostgreSQL, and deployed on Railway with Groq LLM integration (llama-3.3-70b-versatile for all agents).
