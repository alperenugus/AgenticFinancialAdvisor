An AI-powered financial advisor system built with Spring Boot and React, implementing a streamlined multi-agent architecture using LangChain4j. The system features four specialized AI agents (Portfolio Management, Market Analysis, Web Search, and Social Sentiment Analysis) that coordinate through an orchestrator agent to provide personalized investment advice. Key technical achievements include real-time WebSocket streaming of agent reasoning steps and tool execution for transparent decision-making, direct tool call tracking with human-friendly formatting in a dedicated thinking panel, real-time market data integration via Alpha Vantage API with mandatory tool usage enforcement to prevent outdated training data, Google OAuth integration for secure authentication, portfolio management with automatic gain/loss calculations and price refresh, web search via Tavily MCP (Model Context Protocol) and social sentiment analysis from financial Twitter for market insights, professional financial analyst-level analysis including technical patterns, stop-loss levels, and entry/exit strategies, per-session rate limiting using Bucket4j token bucket algorithm to prevent API abuse, and comprehensive security measures with JWT authentication and input validation. Built with Java 21, Spring Boot, LangChain4j, React, PostgreSQL, and deployed on Railway with Groq LLM integration (llama-3.3-70b for orchestration).
